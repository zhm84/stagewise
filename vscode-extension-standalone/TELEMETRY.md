# Telemetry Data Collection

This standalone build of the stagewise extension **does not collect or send any telemetry**. PostHog and analytics code have been removed. We take your privacy seriously and are committed to transparency about our data collection practices.

## What We Collect

We collect the following types of telemetry data:

### System Metadata
- Extension activation events (`extension_activated`)
  - IDE information (VS Code version)
- Loading of workspace with web apps (`opened_web_app_workspace`)
  - When a workspace with some popular web framework is loaded
- Toolbar connection events (`toolbar_connected`)
- Agent usage (`agent_prompt_triggered`)
  - When the AI agent is invoked
- Toolbar setup events (`toolbar_auto_setup_started`)
  - When the automatic toolbar setup process is initiated
- Getting started panel events (`getting_started_panel_shown`, `getting_started_panel_manual_show`, `interacted_with_getting_started_panel`, `dismissed_getting_started_panel`, `clicked_setup_toolbar_in_getting_started_panel`, `clicked_open_docs_in_getting_started_panel`)
  - When the getting started panel is shown automatically to new users or manually opened
- User feedback (`post_setup_feedback`)
  - Feedback provided by users after toolbar setup (includes feedback type, text, and optional email for follow-up)
- Toolbar update recommendation events (`show_toolbar_update_notification`, `toolbar_update_notification_auto_update`, `toolbar_update_notification_ignored`, `toolbar_update_notification_dismissed`)
  - When users get recommended updating the stagewise toolbar on loading of workspaces
- Toolbar integration recommendation events (`show_toolbar_integration_notification`, `toolbar_integration_notification_ignore`, `toolbar_integration_notification_dismissed`)
  - When users get recommended integrating the toolbar into their project
- Toolbar dependency auto-updating triggered (`toolbar_auto_update_prompt_sent`)
  - When users trigger an auto-update sequence for the toolbar packages
- Telemetry setting changes (`telemetry_disabled`, `telemetry_enabled`)
  - When users opt-out or opt-in to telemetry collection
- Authentication events (`authenticate_command_triggered`, `logout_command_triggered`, `check_auth_status_command_triggered`)
  - When users trigger authentication-related commands

#### Privacy Events
- `telemetry_disabled`: Triggered when a user disables telemetry collection
  - Tracked once when the setting changes, before telemetry is actually disabled
  - Helps us understand opt-out rates and improve our privacy practices
- `telemetry_enabled`: Triggered when a user re-enables telemetry collection
  - Tracked when users opt back in after previously disabling telemetry

#### Error Events
- `activation_error`: Triggered when the extension fails to activate
  - Includes: Error message (scrubbed of PII)

  - Includes: reason (expired/invalid/missing), retry attempt number, error message (scrubbed of PII)

### Data Collection Method

We use pseudonymization to protect user privacy while maintaining data quality:
- Each user is assigned a consistent but non-identifying hash
- This allows us to understand usage patterns without identifying individuals
- The hash is generated from system information and cannot be reversed
- No direct connection between the hash and user identity is maintained

## What We Don't Collect

We do NOT collect:
- Personal identifiable information (PII) except for optionally provided email addresses during feedback
- File contents or file names
- User names
- Project-specific information
- Workspace paths or repository names
- Any sensitive data

## How to View Telemetry Events

You can view all telemetry events that this extension may send by:

1. Running the VS Code CLI command:
   ```bash
   code --telemetry
   ```
2. Examining our [telemetry.json](./telemetry.json) file
3. Using the VS Code command "Developer: Show Telemetry" to see live events

## How to Opt Out

You can disable telemetry collection in two ways:

### 1. VS Code Global Setting
To disable telemetry for all extensions:
1. Open VS Code Settings (Ctrl+,/Cmd+,)
2. Search for "telemetry"
3. Set `telemetry.telemetryLevel` to "off"

### 2. Extension-Specific Setting
To disable telemetry just for stagewise:
1. Open VS Code Settings (Ctrl+,/Cmd+,)
2. Search for "stagewise telemetry"
3. Uncheck "stagewise: Telemetry Enabled"

## Data Usage

The collected pseudonymized data helps us:
- Understand how features are used
- Identify and fix bugs
- Improve extension performance
- Guide development priorities
- Enhance user experience

## GDPR Compliance

We are committed to GDPR compliance:
- All data collection is opt-out
- Data is pseudonymized, not anonymized
- No personal data is collected
- Clear documentation of all collected data
- Easy opt-out mechanisms
- Transparent data handling practices
- Right to be forgotten (data deletion upon request)

## Data Retention

- Pseudonymized telemetry data is retained for a maximum of 90 days
- Error reports are retained for 30 days
- All data is automatically deleted after retention period
- Data is stored securely in compliance with industry standards
