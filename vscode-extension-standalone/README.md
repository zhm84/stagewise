## What is the IDE Bridge extension?

This extension connects stagewise to the agents that are included in many popular IDE or extensions.

When starting the stagewise CLI in "Bridge mode", the toolbar will search for other agents running locally.

Installing this extension will make the agent inside the IDE available in the stagewise toolbar.
